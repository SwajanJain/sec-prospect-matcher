# SEC Filing Types: Complete Reference for Alma News

## How Many Types Exist?

There are **~490+ SEC form/submission types** in EDGAR — far more than the handful commonly cited. The SEC maintains an official [Forms Index](https://www.sec.gov/submit-filings/forms-index), and publishes [EDGAR filing counts by form type](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/number-of-edgar-filings-by-form-type) reflecting the full ecosystem.

For Alma News, roughly **30-40 form types** are practically relevant. Here's the watchlist organized by signal strength:

---

## Tier 1: Direct Liquidity / Wealth Realization (Highest Donation-Opportunity Signal)

These tell gift officers: **"This person just got money or is about to."**

### Insider Ownership & Selling

| Form | What It Is | Signal for Gift Officers |
|------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Form 3** | Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership | Prospect just became an insider (officer/director/10%+ owner) — career milestone + wealth signal |
| **Form 4** | Changes in Beneficial Ownership (due within 2 days) | Prospect bought/sold stock, exercised options, RSUs vested — **exact share counts and prices**. Stock sale = liquidity event = time to call |
| **Form 5** | Annual Ownership Summary | Catches transactions not reported on Form 4. Year-end cleanup of insider holdings |
| **Form 144** | Notice of Proposed Sale of Restricted/Control Securities | Prospect **is about to sell** restricted stock — upcoming liquidity |

### Large Ownership / Concentrated Wealth

| Form | What It Is | Signal |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Schedule 13D** (+13D/A) | Beneficial Ownership >5% (activist) | Major concentrated wealth. Amendments signal increasing/decreasing stakes |
| **Schedule 13G** (+13G/A) | Beneficial Ownership >5% (passive) | Same wealth signal, passive investor variant |

### IPO / Going Public / Becoming Liquid

| Form | What It Is | Signal |

| **Form 8-A / 10-12B / 10-12G** | Securities Registration | Listing/registration events around going public |

### M&A / Take-Private / Cashout Events

| Form | What It Is | Signal |

| **SC TO** (Tender Offer filings) | Tender Offer Schedules | Buyout offers — prospect's shares being acquired at premium |
| **Schedule 13E-3** (+amendments) | Going Private Transaction | Company being taken private — cash-out event for shareholders |

### Institutional Wealth Proxy (Fund Manager Prospects)

| Form | What It Is | Signal |

### Executive / Board Changes & Major Corporate Events

| Form | What It Is | Signal |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Form 8-K** (+8-K/A) | Current Report — the "something happened" workhorse | Exec appointment/departure, material agreements, financings, acquisitions, restructuring. Prospect named as new CEO = congratulations call + wealth signal |

### Compensation & Governance (Best "Wealth Context" Document)

| Form | What It Is | Signal |

| **10-Q** (+amendments) | Quarterly Report | May mention personnel changes, less directly useful |
| **NT 10-K / NT 10-Q** | Late Filing Notice | Company in distress or transition — contextual signal |

### Foreign Issuers (Same Signals, Non-US Companies)

| Form | What It Is | Signal |

## Current SEC Prospect Matcher Note

The existing system scans raw SEC text files without distinguishing form type. Adding form-type awareness would allow:

1. **Prioritized scanning** — Process Form 4s and DEF 14As first (highest signal density per file)
2. **Tagged matches** — Gift officers immediately know *why* a prospect appeared
3. **Filtered alerts** — Let clients choose which filing types trigger notifications
